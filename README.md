# Senate Thinking

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the position paper: **Senate Thinking: Positioning AI in the Assembly of Human Knowledge**. This repo acts as an open archive for the paper, enabling access, discussion, and collaboration on the proposed conceptual framework for human-AI knowledge integration.

Part of the [Agora-Supercluster](https://github.com/torisan-unya/Agora-Supercluster), this project advances Human-AI Collaboration (HAC) principles.

## Overview

The paper introduces "Senate Thinking"â€”a metaphorical framework for integrating AI into humanity's collective knowledge assembly. It draws on historical analogies (e.g., Roman Senate expansion, Dutch East India Company governance, Haudenosaunee Confederacy consensus) and applies World-Systems Theory to analyze power dynamics. Core contribution: four first principles (**Selection, Weighting, Oversight, Exclusion**) for human-centered governance, mitigating risks like epistemic dependency and bias.

Structured as a polyphonic inquiry bridging humanities and technology, it features tailored plain-language summaries, a conceptual lexicon, historical precedents, and open questions for future research.
